<Tip>**Before you attempt to integrate our SDK please read this document in its entirety.**</Tip>

## Accessing the SDK

The innerworks Web SDK is an npm package and can be found here: [Innerworks-Web-SDK.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@innerworks-me/iw-auth-sdk)\
Run the following command in your terminal to install the latest version of the SDK:
```
npm i @innerworks-me/iw-auth-sdk
```

## Steps to Achieve a Successful Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
        ### Identifying a Suitable Location to Integrate

        When integrating the Innerworks SDK a suitable location within your site needs to be identified as a suitable integration point.\
        The below is a non-exhaustive list of considerations to consider when choosing a location:

        <Icon icon="check" size={25} /> When a user leaves the page, it is difficult for them to get back to?\
        <Icon icon="check" size={25} /> Will all users have to flow through this part of your site (i.e. an Onboarding Flow)?\
        <Icon icon="check" size={25} /> Is user interaction required on this page (i.e. Typing and Mouse Movement/Click)?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    ### Key Events Required for an Integration

        The Innerworks SDK is designed to sit invisibly in the background to perform metric collection. To ensure optimal performance, the page where the SDK is instantiated should require the user to perform a set of actions. This should include entering text and mouse movements and/or clicks. Typical locations are sign in or sign up pages. 
        Additionally, there will need to be some event which should be hooked into to trigger the sending of the metrics to the Innerworks API. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step">
    ### Integrating into your Codebase

    Once you have identified a suitable location on your site, **import the `InnerworksMetrics` object.**

    ```Typescript
    import { InnerworksMetrics } from "@innerworks/iw-auth-sdk";
    ```

    **Initialise the InnerworksMetrics object in your page, providing your PROJECT_ID and a css selector of a button on the page.**\
    This button will trigger the sending of the metrics to the innerworks API and should be after user interaction on the page has taken place.
    ```Typescript
    const [innerworksMetrics, setInnerworksMetrics] = useState<InnerworksMetrics>();

    useEffect(() => {
        setInnerworksMetrics(new InnerworksMetrics("YOUR_PROJECT_ID", "ID_OF_YOUR_BUTTON"));
    }, [setInnnerworksMetrics]);
    ```

    **Send Metrics on Button Press**\
    When the user clicks the button, call `send`, passing in a UUID for the user. This can be an email, username, or wallet address.\
    A boolean value will be returned indicating the success of the request.
    ```Typescript
        if (innerworksMetrics) { // necessary if using typescript
            const metricsSendSuccess = await innerworksMetrics.send("THE_UNIQUE_ID");
        }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
